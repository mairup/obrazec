Obrazec transformed into a node app with express for dynamic content loading

Items on the display are loaded from a JSON file. Item descriptions are also created with javascript, pulling data from the JSON file.

Sadly I have lost some files so it lacks some important functionality. The project was used to learn about backend javascript briefly (I didn't really know what I was doing and it shows in the code).
